# Ethylpad UI

The UI for my clone of Etherpad. Needs [server](https://github.com/xprazak2/ethylpad) to work properly.

### Running the project

Once you have cloned the project, install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
cd ethylpad_ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open it and click around.

You now have a fully functional Sapper project! To get started developing, consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev).
